I made this program for compare catalogs.
It can be useful for K.K. music.
You have to made 2 files called "List1.txt" and "List2.txt" where you copy paste a list.
I suggest to use nookazon.com, made your own page and copy the text, they won't be troubles.
Remember to press "Load More" how much is necessary at the end of the page for load all the list.
It's usefull use Nookazon for have a same vocabulary of terms.

What's to do? Put the 2 txt files in the same directory of the program.
Open "Animal Crossing New Horizons list comparator" and chose between:
1)Compare 2 listes
2)See which songs you need.
